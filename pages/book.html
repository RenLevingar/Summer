I did't take this class during the sc hool year because I wanted to take a different required class, that class being chemistry. In a sad twist of fate chemistry became a non required class the year after me taking meaning I wasted that entire year. This left me taking Earth Science over the summer and a bit into the school year. The class was fun and learning about the various different parts of the Earth like the bioshpere, lithosphere, atmosphere, and the hydrophere.</p>
